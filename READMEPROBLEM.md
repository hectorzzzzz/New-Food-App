There're missing/error components/aspects:

- Cart icon can't be loaded.
- An error always occurs on the menu page every time a user logs in (likely because the cart is initially empty before adding or removing an item).
- Restaurant images, names, and addresses can't be loaded on the order page. 
- Dishes from the previous session are still there. When a user logs in again and tries to check out new dishes, they stack up. //maybe a log out feature will help (?) so we can wipe the old data
- When a user tries to go back to the previous page (e.g., from the order page to the checkout page), the dishes are missing, and an error occurs.
